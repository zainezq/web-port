Here is a link that is useful on jumpstarting a car: [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdnkRQF5Cps&ab_channel=Cars.com)

-   How to jump-start a car:
    1.  Connect the red clamp to the positive terminal on the dead battery.
    2.  Connect the other red clamp to the positive terminal on the live battery.
    3.  Connect the black clamp to the negative terminal on the live battery.
    4.  Attach the other black clamp to an unpainted metal surface on the car with the dead battery.
    5.  Start the live car, then the dead car.
-   Temporary fixes for leaks (e.g., radiator sealant for coolant leaks).
-   How to replace a flat tire:
    -   Locate spare tire, jack, and wrench.
    -   Loosen lug nuts, jack up the car, replace the tire, tighten lug nuts in a crisscross pattern.
