## 💻 Code Snippets

Here’s a simple TypeScript snippet to start with:

```typescript
function greet(name: string): string {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

console.log(greet('world'));
```

Now let's add some HTML for variety:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>My Blog</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to My Blog</h1>
    <p>This is an example HTML snippet.</p>
