# Final Year Project

This project is titled "Overcoming Cognitive Overload - Designing an AI-Based Note-Taking Solution". This is my final year project at the University Of Birmingham, as well as being my biggest project to date. In this project I aim to design a note taking solution that is both easy to use and effective whilst reducing the overload of information through the use of AI and NLP.
