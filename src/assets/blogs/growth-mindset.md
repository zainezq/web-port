# Building a Growth Mindset

This topic is something that I've been wanting to talk about for a while, and the reason is because of how important it is as human beings to have this **growth mindset**. You might ask "why? what is the need when I can just have a fixed mindset?". The answer is simple: having a growth mindset is essential for personal and professional success. This is what I wanted to talk about in this blog, and I hope you find it useful!

## What Is a Growth Mindset?

The term *growth mindset* was introduced by psychologist **Dr. Carol Dweck** in her research on motivation and learning. It refers to the belief that our abilities, intelligence, and talents can be developed through **effort, learning, and persistence**. Take for example the muscles in our body, we develop them through repeated "reps" and consistent effort. The same applies to our intelligence, talents, and abilities; we can develop them through effort, learning, and persistence.

This contrasts with a **fixed mindset**, where people believe their intelligence and talents are static traits, they either "have it" or they don’t.

### Growth Mindset vs. Fixed Mindset

| Growth Mindset | Fixed Mindset |
|---------------|--------------|
| Challenges are opportunities to grow | Challenges are threats to avoid |
| Failure is a stepping stone for learning | Failure defines intelligence and worth |
| Effort is the path to mastery | If you have to try, you're not naturally talented |
| Constructive criticism is valuable | Criticism is a personal attack |
| Inspired by others' success | Feels threatened by others' success |

## Why Does a Growth Mindset Matter?
The question now might arise, "why does a growth mindset matter?"
Having a growth mindset is **not just motivational jargon,** but it has real benefits, here are some of them:

- **Increases resilience:** People with a growth mindset are more likely to persist in the face of challenges, which ultimately allows you to grow in multiple ways.
- **Encourages continuous learning:** Lifelong learning is something so valued and desired (subject for another blog?), and a growth mindset goes hand in hand with it.
- **Boosts performance:** Research shows that students and professionals with a growth mindset perform better over time. This "performance" can be related to arbitrary things like academic success, job performance, or personal growth.
- **Improves relationships:** It helps people handle feedback better and build stronger connections with others.

## How to Develop a Growth Mindset

### 1. **Reframe Failure as Learning**
Instead of viewing failure as proof of inadequacy, see it as feedback. Ask yourself:
- *What can I learn from this?*
- *How can I approach this differently next time?*

The questions I always ask myself are "What did I do that went well?" and "What can I do differently next time?"

### 2. **Challenges should be embraced**
A common trap of a fixed mindset is avoiding challenges to protect your self-esteem. Instead:
- Take on **new projects** that push your abilities.
- Step outside your **comfort zone** regularly.
- Remind yourself: *Every expert was once a beginner*.

### 3. **Use "Yet" to Change Your Self Talk**
Pay attention to your inner dialogue (yes we all have one, even if we don't realise it). If you catch yourself saying:
> *"I'm not good at this."*

Reframe it to:
> *"I'm not good at this **yet**."*

This small change can shift your perspective from **impossibility to potential**.

### 4. **Value Effort Over Talent**
Society often glorifies natural talent, but effort is what leads to mastery. Instead of aiming to be "the best," focus on:
- Developing **discipline and consistency**.
- Tracking your **progress** rather than comparing yourself to others.
- Celebrating small wins along the way.

## Final Thoughts

A **growth mindset** isn’t something you "get" overnight, it takes a while to cultivate. It’s a daily practice. It requires self awareness, patience, and a willingness to embrace discomfort. But once achieved, it can take you to unimaginable heights.

I honestly feel as though the best thing that worked for me was shifting my mindset, being positive about the situations I am in and learning to embrace the now.

I hope this inspires you even in the slightest :)
