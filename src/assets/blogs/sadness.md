# Sadness as an emotion


By Zaine

---

Emotions. We all feel them on a daily basis. Happiness, anger, sadness, fear and disgust. They come and they go, sometimes for a long duration, and at other times merely for a few seconds. Sadness in particular is an interesting emotion; I say this for two reasons: the first is that it reminds us of what matters to us, and the second is that it makes you realise things about yourself that you never knew of before. Sadness is something that honestly makes you step out of your own body and view things in a different light, you become more perceptive despite the phyiscal and mental tang you feel. Should we strive to stop feeling sad? Who knows, some may say it's a part of who we are, others may counter and say that it's not a desired emotion. Regardless, we all have felt it at some point in our lives; the quantity of which varies across people, for some, it could be very minute and for some very large.

> "Some psychologists argue that sadness plays an evolutionary role—it slows us down, forces us to think, to reflect, to re-evaluate our priorities. It’s the brain’s way of making us pause, take stock, and reorient ourselves."

There comes that word: *pause*. How important is it to sometimes just pause and reflect, to ponder over life and the things happening around us? When was the last time we sat in silence with no distractions, no phones, no people, just nothing? We learn a lot when we tune in to our emotions, despite how much sadness may hurt, and how much it makes us want to cry, we should always remember that this same sadness adds value to the happy moments in life. Like shadows on a painting, it gives dimension to our emotional world.

It reminds me of this verse in the noble Quran:

**فَإِنَّ مَعَ الْعُسْرِ يُسْرًا**

which means: "So, surely with hardship comes ease." The hardship we face in life always has a positive aspect to it, sometimes we become too blinded and short sighted by the trials and tribulations that we forget to look at it from another angle.

Anyways I'll end this with this poetic touch:
> "Sadness doesn’t shout. It whispers. It sits beside you in silence. It tugs at your sleeve when the world moves too fast. And in that quiet tug, you find pieces of yourself you forgot existed."
