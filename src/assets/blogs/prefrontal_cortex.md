### **Preface**

Why is it so difficult to resist a late-night snack or to maintain our self-imposed objectives? Our brains' complex wiring holds the solution. "The Science of Self-Discipline" by Peter Hollins, a book which I was reading, says that it's not just about willpower but also about how well our brain's various components cooperate. This blog will explore the prefrontal cortex and other areas relating to self discipline.

### **The Brain's CEO: The Prefrontal Cortex**

Consider your brain's prefrontal cortex (PFC) to be its CEO. It is responsible for "executive functions" such as impulse control, planning, and decision-making. Your PFC is taking over when you fight the need to browse social media while working.

The PFC's neuroplasticity is one of its best features. This indicates that while heredity (biological inheritance) plays a part in self-discipline, it is not entirely lost because it can become stronger with effort. Research indicates that practices such as mindfulness meditation can expand grey matter in the PFC, improving our capacity to control our behaviour. In the well-known "marshmallow test," kids who were able to postpone gratification by waiting for a second marshmallow ended up with better life outcomes.

### **Aiding Participants: Additional Brain Areas Impacting Self-Control**

Other parts of the brain are essential for self-discipline, even if the PFC is the main player:

- **Amygdala** The amygdala is an almond shaped region in the brain that controls emotions such as anger and fear. The PFC can become overpowered when we are stressed or anxious, and it is the amygdala that overpowers the PFC, ultimately leading to impulsive decisions. For example, the amygdala frequently takes over our reactions before the PFC can calm us down, which is what leads to road rage.

- **Basal Ganglia**: The basal ganglia helps in automating behaviours and are in charge of habit formation. Self-discipline is made simpler by good habits since they demand less conscious effort, there is a famous arabic saying: ما تكرر تقرر, which translates to "What is repeated becomes established", meaning that the habits we repeat tend to be the habits that stick to us. Building enduring habits can be facilitated by beginning with simple, regular behaviours, like reading for 5 minutes before bed.

- **Anterior Cingulate Cortex (ACC)**: This area of the brain controls emotional reactions and recognises mistakes. When things get difficult, a functioning ACC keeps us on course and helps us overcome obstacles.

- **Dopaminergic Pathways (Reward System)**: Dopamine is released during enjoyable activities by the brain's reward system: the nucleus accumbens. This explains the allure of instant gratification, such as checking your phone for notifications.

### **How Self-Discipline Works: A Brain-Based Process**

Self-discipline is often a tug-of-war between different brain regions. The PFC knows you should wake up early to exercise, but the amygdala prefers the comfort of staying in bed. This internal conflict is why self control can feel so challenging.

Dopamine, a neurotransmitter, plays a dual role. It motivates you to take action but can also lead to addictive behaviors if not managed well. Gamification, like fitness apps with streaks, uses dopamine to encourage consistent behavior by rewarding small wins.

The brain will naturally prioritise short term rewards, hence techniques like visualisation and writing can shift this focus, which ultimately will enable the PFC to prioritise long term benefits over instant gratification.

### **Building Self-Control: Useful Advice**

The following are some methods to improve self-discipline that have scientific support:

**Mindfulness Practices**: Mindfulness enhances the PFC and decreases amygdala activity. Inhaling for four seconds, holding for four, and expelling for six is a basic breathing technique that helps one focus and relax.

- **Developing Positive Habits**: Apply the "cue-routine-reward" cycle. For instance, put your running shoes by the door (trigger), jog (routine), and then take a cool shower (reward). A good starting place to learn more about habit formation and the intricate science behind it is the famous book of James Clear titled "Atomic Habits"

**Managing Stress**: Excessive stress might impair the PFC's ability to regulate. The parasympathetic nervous system can be activated by methods such as splashing cold water to ones face or practicing progressive muscle relaxation, which will help maintain ones composure.

- **Dopamine Detox**: As mentionned before, this is a double edged sword, one can reduce overstimulation by avoiding social media, binge-watching, or sugary snacks for a set period. This resets the brain’s reward system, making it easier to focus on meaningful tasks.

### **Conclusion**

Along with other brain regions, the prefrontal cortex provides the foundation for self discipline. If one actively gets an understanding of how these different parts work together, deliberate steps can be taken to strengthen self control. Start small, pick one of the tips and practice it daily. Over time, these small changes will lead to significant improvements.

Remember, self-discipline is like a muscle, the more one trains it, the stronger it becomes. As the Stoic philosopher Epictetus said, "No man is free who is not master of himself."
