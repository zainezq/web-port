This is a quick blog regarding the completion of 2 modules and my reflections on what's to come. 
The two modules are titled as: `Advanced Functional Programming` and `Intelligent Software Engineering`. I particularly found the former quite difficult due to the complexity of the module and the amount of proofs required. The latter was quite enjoyable for a new module, the content was quite interesting and the things learnt will translate well in future career. So what's next? As graduation day is closing in, I am finding things to fill the time with, things that I know will be beneficial in terms of my professional life. One thing, in particular, that I wish to complete is the [Home Lab](/projects/home-lab) project that I plan on centralising (essentially having a machine that will contain all the services I need and reverse proxied so I can access from anywhere in the world). One other thing I am working on is transitioning from the Intellij IDE to using Emacs as my IDE. This means I need to setup LSP-Mode, Projectile and Treesitter (and various other things, I plan on firstly migrating my frontend stack, then will migrate Java as well). 
Thanks for reading!
