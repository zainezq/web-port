```
The person you wanted to be there for you most wasn't there.
Loneliness can kill.
And in the end, it did.
Not with violence, not with noiseâ€”
Just a quiet slipping,
like a candle that knew no one was coming to light it again.
The world kept turning,
but he stepped off,
and no one noticed until the silence started to echo.
```
