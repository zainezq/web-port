I recently came across a link to a notion page which showed a student's reading log. I scrolled all the way down and there were easily over 100 books and articles which this person has read and made notes on. Of course, as someone who loves reading, this tempted me to do the same, except I wasn't exactly a fan of notion (anymore), due to its annoying AI feature and privacy concerns. Hence, I decided to look into different notion alternatives that provided a **database**, which was the most important thing I needed. After some searching and trialling, I decided to stick with [Anytype](https://anytype.io/).

My primary goal with this is to store all the books and articles I read, and to use the [Garden](https://garden.zainezq.com) as the place to talk about (some of) them. At the moment it's still in it's infancy, but with time, this can quickly turn into one like that student's reading log.
