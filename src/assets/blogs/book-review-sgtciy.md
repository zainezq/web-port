# Summary

By Zaine Qayyum

The book titled "So Good They Can't Ignore You" by Cal Newport has truly been a pleasure to read, so much so that I wasn't able to put the book down and I would end up reading pages after pages. The reason why this book has been so popular is because it argues against the popular and conventional belief that we should follow our passions and *then* find work that matches this passion. 

Of course, many of us (myself included) believed in this *passion hypothesis* to some extent, thus, the author debunks this and presents 4 simple rules which can help us in our quest to find work we love. These rules are:

1) Don't follow your passion
2) Be so good they can't ignore you
3) Turn down a promotion (or, the importance of control)
4) Think small, act big (or, the importance of mission)

Essentially, the book encourages a shift in mindset, from a "passion-first" to a "craftsman mindset", in other words, going from "what can the world do for me" to "what can I do for the world". A focus and emphasis is placed on developing rare and valuable skills relevant to a persons field (career capital), then you can cash in these skills for rare and valuable traits.

What I liked most about this book is the personas, each chapter contained real-life examples that supported the point the author was trying to make, not only that, but the author would also explain how these people have been applying previous rules explained in their lives. Another thing that was quite insightful was the summary of the book. I say this because one can simply introduce rules and principles but not apply them in their own lives; the author explains in length how he applied these rules into his own life and the results they yielded.

Below is a personal summary of the four rules, which is also posted on the [garden](https://garden.zainezq.com/Books/so-good-they-cant-ignore-you).

Some of these points have been inspired from this
[website](https://jasonkwanhc.medium.com/book-summary-of-so-good-they-cant-ignore-you-58cb236fef0d).


### Rule #1: **Don’t Follow Your Passion**

1. The Passion Hypothesis is the biggest myth in occupational happiness. It says that “The key to occupational happiness
   is to first figure out what you are passionate about and then find a job that matches this passion”, the author
   argues against this.
2. He mentions some incidents of people like Steve Jobs, proving that successful people like him (who is famous for the
   concept "follow your passions") didn’t start off because he had a passion for the thing they do.

### Rule #2: Be So Good They Can’t Ignore You (Or, the importance of skills)

1. The traits that define great work are rare and valuable, if you want these traits, you need rare and valuable skills.
   These skills are called **Career Capital**.
2. Adopt the **Craftsman Mindset** where instead you focus on what you can offer the world. This is in stark contrast to
   the **Passion Mindset** where you focus on what the world can offer you. The craftsman mindset focuses on becoming
   better and improving the quality of what you produce. It focuses on becoming so good they can’t ignore you,
   regardless of what you do for a living.
3. The concept of **Deliberate Practice** is mentioned where you deliberately stretch your
   abilities beyond where you're comfortable and then receive ruthless feedback on your performance.
4. 5 Steps on applying the deliberate practice in your work:
   1. **Step 1: Decide What Type of Capital Market You’re Competing In.**  There are two kinds of markets, a
      *winner-take-all* market and an *auction* market. In a winner-take-all market, there's only one type of career
      capital available and only one that matters. In the auction market however, there are a variety of relevant
      skills that could *lead* you to getting the job, in other words, there are a variety of career capital available.
   2. **Step 2: Identify Your Capital Type**. This step makes you figure out what are the relevant skills that are
      needed in order to be great at your job. In the winner-take-all market, it's pretty straightforward that it's
      that one career capital, however in the auction market there's more flexibility. A useful heuristic mentioned is
      the *open-gates* opportunities present. In other words, those opportunities to build capital that are already
      open to you, then you work your way up.
   3. **Step 3: Define “Good”** . Having a clear view of what *good* means is important. This step forces you to think
      about where you want to be and how you can achieve it using deliberate practice. This definition will be
      different for different people.
   4. **Step 4: Stretch and Destroy**. Deliberate practice requires you to be uncomfortable, as it is something that is
      not enjoyable. The important thing is to push beyond your comfort zone and get immediate feedback to steer you in
      the right direction.
   5. **Step 5: Patience**. The acquisition of career capital will take time, therefore, it is necessary to be patient
      and ensure that you pour all your effort into the capital you seek. The final sentence given in the book before
      the summary is: **You stretch yourself, day after day, month after month, before finally looking up and
      realising, "Hey, I've become pretty good, and people are starting to notice".**

### Rule #3: Turn Down a Promotion (Or, the importance of control)

1. The author here explains that once you've acquired a certain amount of career capital, your next step is to invest
   in those traits that define great work. Discussion was made about control, and the common pitfalls that people fall
   into.
2. The law of financial viability: when pursuing a project or career path, it's crucial to seek evidence that people
   are willing to pay for it. If that evidence exists, it's a good sign to proceed; if not, it's better to reconsider or pivot.

### Rule #4: Think Small, Act Big (Or, the importance of Mission)

1. This rule focuses on the importance of having a mission in your work. Having a unifying focus for your career, a
   sense of purpose, can make your work more meaningful and impactful.
2. A good career mission is similar to a scientific breakthrough, discovered in the adjacent possible of your field.
   You will need to acquire enough career capital to be able to get into the *cutting edge* of your field. Once you
   get into this cutting edge, you can then start to see these missions.
3. Think small, act big. Instead of focusing on a huge experiment with little feedback, focus on small experiments
   that yield concrete feedback, and use this to guide you into the direction surrounding your general mission.
