# Digital Garden

I recently stumbled across this [Website](https://sachachua.com/blog/) and I found the earliest entry therein was from November 2, 2001. That's well over 20 years of blogging. This made me think about revamping this whole 'blogging' concept and turning it into a digital garden[^1]; thus, instead of having a set defined way of writing with limited scope, this will allow for presenting a set of free form, work-in-progress wikis. I can see that some people prefer to use Obsidian to present their notes on certain topics, but for me, I like to use `org-roam` for this. There is actually a really cool thing about this, when you invoke `org-roam-ui-mode`, you get the following:

The main goal of a digital garden is to essentially jot down findings, research and other miscellaneous things that are stumbled across so that whenever something new is learned, the person can then come back and update the knowledge that they previously *had* with their new findings.

I just realised the link to below uses the terms "planted" and "last tended" instead of "created" and "last updated".

Anyways thanks for reading this Monday morning post.
