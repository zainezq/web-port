  <p>I'm a final-year student at the University of Birmingham, majoring in computer science.</p>
  <p>In this website you'll mainly find weekly <a href="/blogs">blogs</a> where I write about really random things that I come across/read/experience. You can also find the current <a href="/projects">projects</a> I am working on as well as ways to contact me. Enjoy!</p>

  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>It would be exhaustive to list all my interests, as they tend to expand almost every week.
  I love using Emacs and Linux as my digital homestead, and I plan on writing more about it in the future. See the <a href="/projects">projects</a> page for a detailed description of what I'm currently working on.
  I plan on reading 25 books this year (because 2025 right??) and HOPEFULLY 5 research papers. You can subscribe to my <a href="/assets/rss-feed.xml" target="_blank">RSS feed</a> to get the latest updates.

    <li><strong>Final Year Project:</strong> Overcoming Cognitive Overload: Designing an AI-Based Note-Taking Solution (Repository is private at the moment)</li>
    <li><strong>Ricing my Linux</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Modifying homelab</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Post grad life thinking</strong></li>
