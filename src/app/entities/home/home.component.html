    <p>Hey there! I'm Zaine, a tech enthusiast and creative thinker who loves diving into all things code and design. From crafting sleek, functional websites to exploring the intricacies of software development, I’m always looking to learn and grow.</p>

    <p>When I’m not coding, you’ll find me:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>📚 Reading up on the latest in tech and innovation</li>
      <li>🎮 Immersed in retro games and tinkering with emulators</li>
      <li>🌿 Experimenting with healthy, halal recipes in the kitchen</li>
      <li>🎨 Sketching and exploring digital art</li>
      <li>🌍 Volunteering to support causes close to my heart</li>
    </ul>

    <p>I’m also fascinated by the intersection of technology and education. My current focus is on building applications that empower and support neurodiverse learners, blending my passion for innovation with a purpose-driven approach.</p>

    <p>Life’s a journey, and I’m here for the ride—code, creativity, and all the adventures in between!</p>
